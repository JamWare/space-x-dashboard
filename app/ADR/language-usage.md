It isn't my native language but I'm using it still in my work.
It helps me improve on my skills and is the native language of my LLM, so things go even faster
both ways.

Using English in the project and no French.
I also consider traveling abroad for work.

## Consequences

(What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?)

No French in the project, it goes faster for me.
