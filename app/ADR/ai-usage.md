## Status

(What is the status, such as proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded, etc.?)
Accepted

## Context

I spent too much time on online tutorials to learn next.js. I started the project in itself a bit too late.

## Decision

(What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?)

I let Claude Code handle almost all the dev. It is superpowerful, more and more every 2 to 4 months.

## Consequences

(What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?)

I learn the existence of more features way faster eg: route groups, how to make a map with react leaflet,
why it is important to validate API data -> TS helps checking data at compile time, zod helps checking API data
at runtime!

It is more difficult to follow the evolutions and understand the project after every prompt.

## Mitigations

I built a personnal .md file (on my Obsidian) with a list of questions for the LLM to try and understand
the things the tools it used and what I am not familiar with yet.
